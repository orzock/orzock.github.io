Holding double Master's degrees in Political Science, at the end of 2019, I landed my first job in the tech industry. That was the starting point where I became interested in B2B marketing.

Having no academic background nor any systematic training, my biggest fears in developing a career are misinterpreting or not getting the point of what people are talking about with work, being slow in production due to lack of marketing knowledge, and most of all, not being seen as a qualified marketing professional.

Sometimes the punch of reality could be hard to take. "But, hey," I tell myself, "if you are able to speak 4 language, survived cancer, and were brave enough to break out your comfort zone and build a life in Europe from scratch (in 2 countries!), girl, you'll be just fine."
