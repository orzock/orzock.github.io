Quote: *"Seeing beyond, understanding within."* - Medivista company motto

## Introduction

Event marketing, an outbound marketing method, allows companies to proactively reach potential clients. Depending on the nature of each trade show, a company can employ different strategies to achieve goals such as raising brand awareness, generating new leads, and expanding business scope. For B2B marketers, it is essential to curate and execute an end-to-end marketing plan for trade shows, including goals and strategies, venue booking and setup, budget planning, and pre- and post-event engagement.

Today, I will demonstrate my approach to preparing a fictional SaaS Medtech startup for one of the industry's biggest events.

## Fictional Company and Background Setting


**Medivista AG**, a pioneering fictional startup founded in 2024 in Lausanne, offers advanced AI-powered medical image analysis for neurological diseases and patient profile management services.

As a thriving company, we are eager to raise brand awareness and build credibility for our product, MedInsight AI. This platform uses cutting-edge AI algorithms to gather and analyze medical images for early lesion detection while maintaining patient profiles.

## Target Trade Show: EURETINA 2024

EURETINA is the leading European society for specialists in vitreoretinal diseases, hosting an annual congress that showcases the latest advancements in retinal care. This exhibition brings together ophthalmologists, researchers, and industry professionals to share knowledge, present cutting-edge research, and demonstrate innovative technologies in retinal diagnostics and treatments.

This year, EURETINA will be held in **Barcelona** from **19 - 22 September**.

For an AI startup like Medivista, EURETINA provides a crucial platform to network with potential clients and partners, gain insights into current clinical needs, and showcase how AI solutions can enhance retinal disease diagnosis and management.

Assuming we are at the beginning of 2024 and would like to allocate **CHF 45,000** to EURETINA, my event marketing plan will include the following:

## 0.1 Presence Strategy & Point of Contact

Since Medivista is a young startup, our goals for attending EURETINA will focus on the following aspects:

- **Product showcase & demonstration:** Highlight MedInsight AI® through demonstration videos, brochures, and in-person demos, incorporating success stories to illustrate its benefits.

- **Brand building:** Raise brand awareness using the company motto “Seeing Beyond, Understanding Within” on social media platforms like LinkedIn. Emphasize the company’s commitment to ophthalmology and its expansion into neurodegenerative, vascular, and rare diseases.

- **Networking & business meeting:** Schedule meetings with potential partners and investors, and participate in forums to showcase the company’s expertise and innovation in the field.

- **Pre-event promotion:** Increase Medvista’s presence leading up to EURETINA 2024 through press releases, email marketing, and social media campaigns. Focus on success stories, the application of MedInsight AI® in new medical domains, and the latest developments in AI healthcare related to ophthalmology and other target areas.

- **Leads management:** Collect and manage contacts during the event. Follow up with potential partners and clients by sending industry updates related to Medvista’s services and products, ensuring continuous communication and strengthening relationships.

To ensure a successful trade show, I will arrange a list of potential vendors, including those for booth design, setup and teardown, marketing material printing, and logistics. Internally, I will coordinate with the sales team, R&D, and the PM department to align our positioning and messaging for the event. Below is a table detailing the points of contact (POC):

## 0.2 Preparation Timeline

Trade show preparation typically takes 4-8 months, depending on the event's scale and the marketing team's size. For EURETINA 2024, as the sole marketer responsible for the exhibition, I would initiate planning 6-7 months in advance to ensure adequate preparation time.

## 0.3 Budget Plan

Before official registration details are available, I would research past event brochures, review previous trade show budgets, and consult colleagues and my line manager for feedback on initial budget drafts. Given Medvista's recent founding, I'll examine last year's EURETINA registration information for guidance.

While registration fees are fixed, booth rental and design costs vary by size. To effectively showcase MedInsight AI, our AI-powered medical image analysis and patient profile management platform, we'll prioritize live demonstrations and success story testimonials. This approach necessitates an attractive booth, so I propose allocating 60% of our budget to the physical venue environment.

The remaining budget would be divided between marketing materials (15%) and on-site staff expenses (25%). As we'll be traveling from Switzerland to Spain, this includes transportation, accommodation, and meals. A detailed budget breakdown follows in the table below.

## 0.4 Sample Ad/ Social Media Post

Finally, before the event, I would also apply some tactics of omnichannel marketing to promote our presence at EURETINA and implement call-to-action for audiences to interact with our post on social media, meet us in person, and even arrange a business meeting with us.

An example of social media post with visual element would look like this:
