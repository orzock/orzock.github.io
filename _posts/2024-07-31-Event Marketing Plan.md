# Introduction

Event marketing, an outbound marketing method which allows companies to proactively reach out potentional clients; according to the nature of each trade show, a company could employ different strategies and tactics to achieve goals such as raising brand awareness, generating new leads, and expanding business scope. Therefore, it is essential for B2B marketers to curate and execute an end-to-end marketing plan for trade shows with meticulous preparation; that said, including goals and strategies, venue booking and setup, budget plan, and pre-engagement and post-engagement.

Today, I would like to demonstrate my approaches of preparing a fictional SaaS startup in Medtech to one of the biggest event in the industry.

# Background Setting

**Medivista AG**, a pioneering fictional startup founded in 2024 in Lausanne, offers advanced AI-powered medical image analysis for neurological diseases and patient profile management services.

As a thriving company, we are eager to raise brand awareness and build solid credibility for our product: MedInsight AI. This platform gathers and analyzes medical images using cutting-edge AI algorithms for early lesion detection while maintaining patient profiles.

**EURETINA** is the leading European society for specialists in vitreoretinal diseases, hosting an annual congress that showcases the latest advancements in retinal care. This exhibition brings together ophthalmologists, researchers, and industry professionals to share knowledge, present cutting-edge research, and demonstrate innovative technologies in retinal diagnostics and treatments. This year, EURETINA will be held in **Barcelona** from **19 - 22 September**.

For an AI startup like Medivista, EURETINA provides a crucial platform to network with potential clients and partners, gain insights into current clinical needs, and showcase how AI solutions can enhance retinal disease diagnosis and management.

Assume that we are at the begining of 2024 and would like to allocate **CHF 4,5000** to EURETINA. My event marketing plan would deploy as the content below:

# 0.1 Presence Strategy & Point of Contact
Since Medivista is a pretty young startup, the goal of our presence in EURETINA would focus on the following aspects:
- **Product showcase & demonstration:** Highlight MedInsight AI® through demonstration videos, brochures, and in-person demos, incorporating success stories to illustrate its benefits.

- **Brand building:** Raise brand awareness using the company motto “Seeing Beyond, Understanding Within” on social media platforms like LinkedIn. Emphasize the company’s commitment to ophthalmology and its expansion into neurodegenerative, vascular, and rare diseases.

- **Networking & business meeting:** Schedule meetings with potential partners and investors, and participate in forums to showcase the company’s expertise and innovation in the field.

- **Pre-event promotion:** Increase Medvista’s presence leading up to EURETINA 2024 through press releases, email marketing, and social media campaigns. Focus on success stories, the application of MedInsight AI® in new medical domains, and the latest developments in AI healthcare related to ophthalmology and other target areas.

- **Leads management:** Collect and manage contacts during the event. Follow up with potential partners and clients by sending industry updates related to Medvista’s services and products, ensuring continuous communication and strengthening relationships.

As for the point of contact, I would arrange a list the candidate list of vendors and point of contact within the company Medivista as shown in the table below:

# 0.2 Preparation Timeline
The overall preparation could take 4-8 months dependts on the event scale and manpower in the marketing team for coordination. In this case, as the only marketer to prepare for the trade show participation, I would kick off my planning process 6-7 months in advance in order to have more buffer.
