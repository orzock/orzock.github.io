# Introduction

Medivista AG, a pioneering fictional startup founded in 2024 in Lausanne, offers advanced AI-powered medical image analysis for neurological diseases and patient profile management services.

As a thriving company, we are eager to raise brand awareness and build solid credibility for our product: MedInsight AI. This platform gathers and analyzes medical images using cutting-edge AI algorithms for early lesion detection while maintaining patient profiles.

EURETINA is the leading European society for specialists in vitreoretinal diseases, hosting an annual congress that showcases the latest advancements in retinal care. This exhibition brings together ophthalmologists, researchers, and industry professionals to share knowledge, present cutting-edge research, and demonstrate innovative technologies in retinal diagnostics and treatments. 

For an AI startup like Medivista, EURETINA provides a crucial platform to network with potential clients and partners, gain insights into current clinical needs, and showcase how AI solutions can enhance retinal disease diagnosis and management.
