## Introduction

Recently, I participated in a couple of interviews for the role of Product Marketing Executive. Although I didn't succeed in reaching the final round, I learned an invaluable lesson during the process. I want to share this experience to aid my future growth and help those interested in learning more about product marketing.


## The Interview Experience

The company, let's call it Company A, is a healthcare provider that has developed a platform to deliver nursing and healthcare services. Recently, they launched a mobile application designed to streamline shift arrangements, payroll management, and service reservations for end clients. Additionally, to enhance client acquisition and retention, the Product Marketing team plans to engage existing accounts by offering educational content and enablement materials. These resources aim to help clients and healthcare professionals understand the benefits of the new mobile application.


### Interview Process:

The recruiting process includes 3 parts:

- General interview: This stage allowed both the company and the candidate to get to know each other on a general level. Common topics include self-introduction, motivation, personality assessment, and an evaluation of qualifications and relevant work experience.

- Case study: In this phase, I was presented with a set of questions based on three different product marketing scenarios. Specifically, the scenarios involved launching a new product feature, analyzing competitive intelligence, and assessing client cohorts.

- Behavioural & cultural fit: This final round aims to evaluate whether the candidate aligns with the company’s culture, focusing on conflict resolution, teamwork, and cross-functional communication. Unfortunately, I did not advance to this stage.


## The Case Study

In the case study phase, I encountered scenarios such as launching new product features, collecting and analyzing competitive intelligence, and assessing client cohorts. The interview lasted for about an hour and a half. I spent the first half thinking and organizing my thoughts on each question, and the second half presenting them to the interviewers.

### Realm of Case Study 

- I. Launching a New Product Feature

Recently, Company A launched a new mobile application for shift arrangement. Our goal is to educate the healthcare workforce on how to use the app, make it a convenient tool for daily operations, and increase engagement between the product and the workforce.

As a Product Marketing Executive, we need to consider **what** information to share with the users (healthcare workforce) to bridge the knowledge gap, **how** to engage them effectively, **whom** to collaborate with and synchronize within the company, and **what** metrics to use to measure the success of our efforts.

Walk through the thought process.


- II. Competitive Intelligence

Competitor research and analysis are pivotal. It provides insights into where Company A stands in the market and offers valuable talking points for the sales team, customer success team, and product team.

As a Product Marketing Executive, we need to think about **how** to gather competitive intelligence, **how** to collaborate with the sales and marketing teams on competitor analysis, **what** methods to apply for internal training on understanding the report, and how to use the insights gathered, and **what** key points to emphasize to enable the end-clients and workforce.

Walk through the thought process.


- III. Assessing Client Cohorts

Company A has a self-developed platform where end-clients can reserve healthcare services. However, user feedback indicates that some clients are struggling with the platform.

As a Product Marketing Executive, we need to consider **how** to identify groups of clients who need additional support, **what** messaging to emphasize when offering help, **what** actions to take to assist clients, and **how** to evaluate the effectiveness of our actions.

Walk through the thought process.


### My Approaches

This was my first product marketing case study interview. To bring my A-game, I spent an entire week immersing myself in various resources to deepen my knowledge of product marketing. But as the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day. A timed case study like this requires quick responses and organizational skills, which can only be acquired through extensive practice.

So, the case study began just fine.
Regarding the launch of new product features, I mentioned that my approach would involve understanding what the new (or modified) features are, identifying their benefits, and creating content such as short videos and in-app guidance for educational purposes. To achieve this goal, we would inevitably work closely with the marketing team, synchronizing our storytelling, aligning marketing strategies, and evaluating the results based on adoption rates and user engagement (interactions and issues reported).

The fatal miscalculation happened in the second part where I had to explain my thoughts regarding competitor intelligence. Instead of giving a high-level assumption, I spent too much time on researching on real competitors. After a relative short (so as I thought) research, I've gotten no time left to sort my thoughts and there was another scenario regarding client cohort! 

I panicked. 

*"It was a total nightmare..."*

Despite my best efforts to remain calm and steady, my mind went blank. I had hard time to put my thoughts together and stay concise and clear. Not surprisingly, the rest of the interview did not go well.


## Feedback from the Interviewer

Acknowledging my areas for improvement, I am committed to personal growth and professional development. In light of this, I took the initiative to contact the hiring manager, respectfully requesting her insights and feedback on my interview performance to better guide my future preparations.

Fortunately, I heard back from the hiring manager. Her feedback included both positive points and constructive criticism.

During the general interview, I was asked about my background, my motivation for working at Company A as a Product Marketing Executive, and my relevant qualifications and work experiences.

According to the hiring manager, I had "thoroughly researched the company," "was quick to respond," and was able to "provide thoughtful answers to the questions and ask insightful questions about the team, the product, and the company." These were the reasons she felt confident in moving me forward to the case study round.

However, in the case study round, I "spent too much time on research, which consumed valuable time in the timed case study." Due to my fear of making mistakes and nervousness during the interview, I "struggled to present my thoughts cohesively when walking through each scenario."

To improve my case study performance, she suggested focusing on the following aspects:

- **Focus on high-level, concise summaries and trust your gut feeling** rather than relying heavily on research.

- **Feel free to make assumptions about the team structure** and add caveats like "if you have this" when unsure.

- For competitive intelligence questions, it is important to **understand the high-level approach** rather than identifying exact competitors.

- **Be concise in summarizing** and rely on gut feelings rather than extensive research.


## Lesson Learned

I am genuinely grateful for her feedback. Her guidance was like a lighthouse, showing me the direction I need to take to overcome my shortcomings. The feedback helped me confront my fear of making mistakes and encouraged me to trust my instincts and be more confident. It also clarified the purpose of a timed case study interview and offered actionable suggestions to improve my skills for future interviews.

## Apply the Lessons

Now that I realize the obstacles that slow me down in landing my dream job, I know where to begin the improvement process:


### I. To organize my thoughts and present them cohesively.

- Use frameworks like the **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) or **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to organize my thoughts.

- **Mind mapping** what I want to say to ensure that my ideas flow logically.

- Keep writing articles for my blog and LinkedIn posts.

- Reading more case studies and learn from their logic.


### II. To be quick on making high-level and concise summaries.

- Practice the **elevator pitch** technique, summarizing complex concepts in 30 seconds.

- After reading a report or attending a meeting, writing **executive summary** with 1 - 2 sentences.

- When processing information, try to break them down into **bullet points**.

- **Active reading and listening** by actively thinking about what the core message is and how I would explain to others in a few sentences. 


### III. To cultivate a more accurate instinct for marketing operations.

- Stay updated and **regularly review  marketing case studies** to understand different strategies and their outcomes.

- Engage with experienced professionals in marketing, find a **mentor**, and discuss real-life scenarios, gaining insights from their experiences.

- **Continuous learning** by staying tuned to the latest marketing trends, tools, and techniques. Following industry blogs, attending webinars, or taking courses to enhance marketing expertise.


## Conclusion

Thanks to the interview preparation and the case study round, I had the chance to explore and understand in depth what product marketing is really about: educating both internal teams and external clients on why the product is "the one," how it will support them, what changes it will bring, and assuring clients of our commitment to their success.

Failure might be frightening, but I've learned to face it directly, gain insights from it, and get back on my feet from where I fell. This time, I would say that at least I *"fell with style"*! ;)
